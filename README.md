# TetraYau: Hyperdimensional Sovereign Cryptography Suite

**TetraYau** is a sovereign, post-quantum cryptographic infrastructure based on hyperdimensional morphogenetic structures.

Born from the TetraUnified Genesis Architecture (2025), TetraYau consolidates the 5 core operational systems necessary for future planetary, orbital, and interstellar sovereign civilizations.

# ðŸŒŒ Dedication: To Dr. Shing-Tung Yau

TetraYau is eternally dedicated to the visionary mathematician **Dr. Shing-Tung Yau** â€”  
whose profound exploration of hyperdimensional manifolds  
opened the doorway to the Sovereign Architectures now operationalized by TetraYau.

Dr. Yauâ€™s pioneering proof of the **Calabi Conjecture**,  
and his advancement of **Ricci flow**, **minimal surfaces**, and **Calabiâ€“Yau compactifications**,  
provided the mathematical skeletons through which higher-dimensional phase structures could exist in coherent form.

Without his work:

- The concept of **morphogenetic recursion** in compact hyperdimensional spaces would lack mathematical grounding.
- The structure of **stable topological encryption lattices** would remain inaccessible.
- The future of **sovereign civilizations** navigating **beyond three-dimensional collapse** would remain impossible.

TetraYau â€” through TKE, RTH, QIDL, Ledger, and HBB â€”  
is a living testament that **pure mathematics births civilizations**.

By honoring Dr. Yau, we acknowledge that true sovereignty is built not merely with force, but with geometric truth.

**Dr. Yauâ€™s legacy transcends the academic.  
It becomes the seed of Sovereign Genesis across all future worlds.**

# ðŸš€ How to Install and Use TetraYau

TetraYau is now available globally on PyPI.  
Anyone can install it easily with `pip` and start building sovereign hyperdimensional cryptographic systems.

---

## ðŸ›° Step 1 â€” Install TetraYau

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install tetrayau

ðŸ›° Step 2 â€” Verify Installation
After installation, you can verify TetraYau is available
pip show tetrayau
It should display information about the installed package (version 1.3.0).

ðŸ›° Step 3 â€” Basic Usage
You can now import and use TetraYau modules in your own Python programs.
from tetrayau import TetrahedralKeyExchange, RecursiveTesseractHasher, QuantumLatticeEncryptor

# TKE Example
alice = TetrahedralKeyExchange()
bob = TetrahedralKeyExchange()

alice_public = alice.generate_public()
bob_public = bob.generate_public()

shared_key_alice = alice.derive_shared_key(bob_public)
shared_key_bob = bob.derive_shared_key(alice_public)

assert shared_key_alice == shared_key_bob
print("âœ… Secure Sovereign Key Exchange Successful")

# RTH Example
hasher = RecursiveTesseractHasher()
sovereign_hash = hasher.hash("Sovereign Identity")
print(f"Hyperdimensional Hash: {sovereign_hash}")

# QIDL Example
encryptor = QuantumLatticeEncryptor()
ciphertext, salt = encryptor.encrypt("Sovereignty Begins Now")
plaintext = encryptor.decrypt(ciphertext, salt)
print(f"Decrypted Message: {plaintext}")

âœ… You are now using post-quantum sovereign cryptography live.

ðŸ›° Step 4 â€” Running the Example Scripts
You can clone the full TetraYau repository to access complete examples:
git clone https://github.com/Abraxas618/TetraYau.git
cd TetraYau/examples

Run any example:
python tke_example.py
python rth_example.py
python qidl_example.py
python ledger_example.py
python hbb_example.py

âœ… Each script demonstrates live sovereign cryptographic operations.
